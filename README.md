# dev-env-gitpod
Mage-OS development environment via Gitpod.
This repo is used to configure a Gitpod environment for contributions for Magento. This repo isn't intended to create an environment for projects based on Magento.

If you are looking for a local docker based Magento development environment [markshust/docker-magento](https://github.com/markshust/docker-magento) is your best bet. It was actually the starting point for this repo.
Big thanks to [Mark Shust](https://github.com/markshust) for the starting point!
